The underlying algorithms are designed to be especially useful in scenarios where the quality and quantity of text of cannot be guaranteed, such as on the Social Web. This makes Twitter a great candidate for experimentation.\r\n\r\n**Key technologies:** Java, REST, HTML5/CSS/JS, PostgreSQL, Redis, AngularJS, D3.js, Web Workers, Amazon EC2\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Xavee.net - Automatic mobile game curation and discovery\r\n\r\n[Xavee](http://www.xavee.net) is an attempt at automatically curating games on the various mobile app stores. It is commonly agreed that it is extremely difficult to find good games on these stores. Xavee's goal is to enhance app discovery and promote diamonds in the rough by re-ranking games by their quality rather than profitability, and offer comprehensive filtering tools to browse and find games more efficiently. The site is available in English and Japanese.\r\n\r\n**Key technologies:** Python/Django, REST, HTML5/CSS/JS, PostgreSQL, AngularJS, ElasticSearch, Heroku\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Midas - Machine learning-based Bitcoin trading\r\n\r\n[Midas](http://github.com/ktslabbie/Midas) is a bot that implements a trading algorithm based on technical analysis, using supervised machine learning on historical data to train its parameters. Training is performed by using linear regression and k-fold cross-validation to avoid overfitting. It is fundamentally an EMA-based trading algorithm, but includes additional indicators and conditionals to react to certain situations more quickly and effectively.\r\n\r\nThe algorithm outperforms simple buy-and-hold and EMA trend following algorithm baselines by over 10x. It is implemented as a Chrome plugin that keeps track of price, updates parameters, and can make trades on the exchange in real-time.\r\n\r\n**Key technologies:** Java, HTML/CSS/JS, Machine learning, Bitcoin, Chrome plugin development\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n# Past and current research\r\n\r\nMy Ph.D research focuses on topic clustering and community detection and visualization on the Social Web. Previously I was active in the Semantic Web field, working on approaches for ontology matching.\r\n\r\n### Selected publications\r\n\r\n* Slabbekoorn, K., Noro, T., Tokuda, T. _Twitter User Recommendation Based on User Relations And Taxonomical Analysis_. 23nd European-Japanese Conference on Information Modelling and Knowledge Bases (EJC), 2013.\r\n* Slabbekoorn, K. and Hollink, L. and Houben, G.J. _Domain-Aware Ontology Matching on the Semantic Web_.
