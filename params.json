The underlying algorithms are designed to be especially useful in scenarios where the quality and quantity of text of cannot be guaranteed, such as on the Social Web. This makes Twitter a great candidate for experimentation.\r\n\r\n### Xavee.net\r\n\r\nXavee is an attempt at automatically curating games on the various mobile app stores. It is commonly agreed that it is extremely difficult to find good games on these stores. Xavee's goal is to enhance app discovery and promote diamonds in the rough by re-ranking games by their quality rather than profitability, and offer comprehensive filtering tools to browse and find games more efficiently. The site is available in English and Japanese.\r\n\r\n### Midas - Machine learning-based Bitcoin trading\r\n\r\nMidas is a bot that implements a trading algorithm based on technical analysis, using supervised machine learning on historical data to train its parameters. Training is performed by using linear regression and k-fold cross-validation to avoid overfitting. It is fundamentally an EMA-based trading algorithm, but includes additional indicators and conditionals to react to certain situations more quickly and effectively.\r\n\r\nThe algorithm outperforms simple buy-and-hold and EMA trend following algorithm baselines by over 10x. It is implemented as a Chrome plugin that keeps track of price, updates parameters, and can make trades on the exchange in real-time.","google":"UA-61167886-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
